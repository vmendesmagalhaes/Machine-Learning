# Machine Learning Repository

In this repository, I try to solve some real world problems applying algorithms and developing models using on machine learning methods.

The adopted metodology to aplly/develop the models is based on Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), proposed by Fayyad in 1996 (the bibliography is missing, I have to add this important part). In short, the KDD process is composed of a set of continuous, interactive and iterative steps, whose objective is to identify patterns that are possible to be understood - in addition to being really useful - based on a large amount of data.

Any doubts, feel free to reach me by email.
